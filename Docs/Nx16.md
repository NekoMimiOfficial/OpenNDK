# Nx16 CPU instructions and specs  

## instruction sheet  
* LD{A, B, C, X}:  
    Loads a value from a RAM address to a register  
* TX{A, B, C}:  
    Transfers a value from a register to a RAM address  
* SUM:  
    Sets a RAM addess value to the sum of reg a + b  
* RET:  
    Used for BIOS interupts  
* HLT:  
    Halts and returns the value of a RAM address  
* JMP:  
    Jumps to a certain RAM address  
* JEQ:  
    Jumps if both reg a and b hold the same value  
* JNQ:  
    Jumps if reg a holds a different value than reg b  

## CPU cycles  
* Fetch -> advances stack pointer  
* Decode -> deoodes ram value into data and opCode  
* Execute -> executes opCode with data
