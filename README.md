# The OpenNDK Project  
OpenNDK is a suite of development utilities to create binaries for the custom Nx16 architecture  
this custom architecture was a hobby project to understand low level computer fundamentals and wouldnt be advised to use in a production environment (for now)  

* every bit of documentation can be found in the `Docs/` directory  
* building info can be found in `Building.md`
